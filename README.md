## Why nnodes?
Nnodes is a workflow manager that makes your life easier when defining or running complicated jobs either in your local computer or in a large-scale cluster. It provides a simple Python interface to define, organize and execute tasks.

- **Simplicity**. Most professional workflow managers have very steep learning curves, and are sometimes deeply bound with specific computing architectures. Nodes, on the other hand, provides a unified interface for all operations and utilizes only high level APIs. Migrating existing workflows to nnodes is seamless in most cases.
- **Flexibility**. Nnodes is not tied to a specific scientific problem, it is like a glue that joins multiple operations.
- **Scalibility**.
